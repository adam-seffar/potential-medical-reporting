I would like to create an app for a medical company, this app would be centralized meaning it can be 
accessed from any computer (Windows), this app's purpose is to store client information that the doctor 
fills at appointments, and with the possibility of printing documents per client or per month, i am torn 
between building it using python and javaScript and between Sql or mongoDB, i also am a developper that 
is never built an app from scratch, could you guide me  ?
